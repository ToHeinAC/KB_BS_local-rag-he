- Verify that nuances and qualifications are maintained
- Ensure context is not lost or distorted

**STRUCTURAL FIDELITY (0-100)**: How well organized and coherent is the answer?
- Evaluate logical flow and organization
- Check for completeness of coverage
- Assess clarity and readability

**SOURCE FIDELITY (0-100)**: How properly are sources cited and attributed?
