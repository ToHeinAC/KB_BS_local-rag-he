## 🔧 Setup Commands (One-time)

```bash
# 1. Setup Cloudflare Tunnel
cd /home/he/ai/dev/langgraph/KB_BS_local-rag-he/login
./cloudflared-setup.sh

# 2. Set environment variables
export LAUNCHER_PASSWORD="your_secure_password"
export LAUNCHER_URL="https://launcher.your-domain.com"
export MAIN_APP_URL="https://rag-app.your-domain.com"

# 3. Test your setup
./test-setup.sh

# 4. Start the launcher (or set up auto-start)
./start-launcher.sh
```

## 🌐 Your URLs

| Service | URL | What It Does |
|---------|-----|--------------|
| **Launcher** | `https://launcher.your-domain.com` | Control panel - you login here |
| **Main App** | `https://rag-app.your-domain.com` | Your RAG researcher - opens from launcher |

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ **Encrypted** - All traffic goes through Cloudflare Tunnel (HTTPS)  
✅ **Authenticated** - Password required for launcher access  
✅ **Isolated** - Apps only accessible via your specific domain  
✅ **No Ports Exposed** - No port forwarding or firewall changes needed  
✅ **Controlled** - You decide when apps start/stop  

## 📦 What Gets Started

When you click "Start App" in the launcher, it executes:

```bash
cd /home/he/ai/dev/langgraph/KB_BS_local-rag-he
uv run streamlit run apps/app_v2_0g.py --server.port 8501 --server.headless true
```

The app runs in the background on your remote machine, accessible via your Cloudflare Tunnel URL.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Can't access launcher URL

```bash
# Check tunnel status
sudo systemctl status cloudflared

# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u cloudflared -f
```

### App won't start

```bash
# Check logs
cat /tmp/rag_app.log

# Verify uv is installed
which uv

# Test manually
cd /home/he/ai/dev/langgraph/KB_BS_local-rag-he
uv run streamlit run apps/app_v2_0g.py
```

### Port already in use

From launcher, click "Stop App" or manually:
```bash
lsof -ti:8501 | xargs -r kill -9
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Auto-start everything**: Set up systemd services for both tunnel and launcher

3. **Monitor logs**: Keep an eye on `/tmp/rag_app.log`
4. **Cloudflare Access**: Add extra authentication layer via Cloudflare dashboard
5. **Share URL**: Only share with trusted users, or keep completely private
